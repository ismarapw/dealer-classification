# Dealer Customer Data Classification
Unlike clustering project, This project is an implementation for classification customer dealer data. The goal of this project is to classify dealer data based on relevant or selected features. This project was made for Machine Learning Course which utilizied **Naive Bayes Algorithm**.

# Key Points
1. Data Visualization.
2. Data Analysis.
3. Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering.
5. Construct Naive Bayes from Scracth.
6. Evaluated Result of the Model based on certain metrics. 

# Installation and Usage
At the beginning, you can clone this repository and you have to make sure that your machine has been installed with Python (3.11.4) and PIP (23.2.1). It is recommended for using virtual environment (venv). Inside the project you can do
```bash
python -m venv env
```
After that, make sure your env is active. Command bellow i used in windows terminal (cmd) for activing my environment
```bash
env\Scripts\activate
```
If your env is active, then you can install all depedencies from the requirements.txt
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
to use the project, you can execute the notebook file in the notebook folder.
``` bash
jupyter notebook #run notebook
```
